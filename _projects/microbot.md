          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>MicroBot is a two-wheel differential drive robot that is controlled by the built-in accelerometer on the Micro:bit. The MicroBot will communicate with other microbots which use a joystick to control the direction and the speed of the wheel on the robot. The joystick controller will use the built-in LEDs matrix that will light up as an arrow in the direction of the joystick and will control the moto velocity.

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>I am responsible for working on the wireless communication for the joystick to send information for the robot to receive using the built-in 2.4GHz radio module from the microbit. I also help work on the motor control using h-bridge.
