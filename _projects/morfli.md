        <div class="my-role">
          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>I founded a startup that creates hands-on educational kits to provide students with engaging and fun education activities. Led the team to develop STEAM product lines aligned with the national government curriculum. Led a team of eight people to build and produce over 2500+ kits for rural Cambodians and generated over $45K in revenue.

    <div class="problem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Students, especially those in public schools, lack access to resources and engaging activities, leading to low student engagement and high dropout rates. The existing Cambodian education system is outdated and does not teach students the 21st century skills necessary for success in the modern workforce. 60% of STEM-related jobs in Cambodia go unfilled because companies cannot find candidates with the requisite skills.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>KlemBox provides affordable, curriculum-aligned kits designed for classroom use with minimal teacher preparation. Covering STEAM and entrepreneurship topics, the kits help students build essential 21st-century skills like problem-solving, communication, and collaboration. To support effective implementation, KlemBox offers online and offline teacher training, including video tutorials, lesson plans, and student guidesâ€”ensuring accessibility even in classrooms with limited internet connectivity. 
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="impact">
          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>KlemBox kits empower students to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills through hands-on experiments and projects. With ready-to-use lesson plans and support materials, we make it seamless for teachers to integrate KlemBox into their curriculum, boosting student engagement and reducing dropout rates. We have provided 400 kits to 455 students in 6 provinces since December 2020.
