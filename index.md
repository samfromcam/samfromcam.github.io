ជំរាបសួរ (Chum Reap Sour) – Hello! My name is Samnang, which means "lucky" in Khmer. I was born in Cambodia and am currently a senior at Northwestern University, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My passion lies in leveraging technology to enhance educational experiences and opportunities.

### I am actively involved in two exciting initiatives:

- Software Engineering Intern at [Morfli, Corp](https://www.morfli.com/): I am contributing to a project from the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, where we are developing innovative solutions to improve learning processes.
- CEO of [Klem Learning Group](http://klembox.co/): As the CEO, I lead efforts to create impactful educational tools and resources that empower learners and educators alike.

This past summer, I had the incredible opportunity to backpack across Cambodia with my family, reconnecting with my roots and gaining new perspectives that continue to inspire my work in education technology.
